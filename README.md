## Features
- Monitor AWS resource usage
- Generate a usage report in a file
- Automate reporting with cron jobs

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, you'll need a working environment with AWS CLI configured and the necessary permissions to access your AWS resources.

### Prerequisites
- AWS CLI installed and configured
- Basic knowledge of shell scripting

## Steps to Follow
1. **Write a Shell Script**
   - Create a shell script that tracks AWS resource usage.
   
2. **Create a Usage Report File**
   - Ensure the script generates a file containing all the resource usage details.
   
3. **Integrate with Cron Job**
   - Set up a cron job to execute the shell script daily at 6 PM, reporting the output automatically.

### Example Shell Script
Hereâ€™s a simple example of what your shell script might look like:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# AWS Resource Usage Tracking Script

# Define output file
OUTPUT_FILE="aws_usage_report.txt"

# Fetch AWS resource usage (Example command)
aws ec2 describe-instances --query "Reservations[*].Instances[*].[InstanceId,InstanceType,State.Name]" > "$OUTPUT_FILE"

# Add a timestamp
echo "Report generated on: $(date)" >> "$OUTPUT_FILE"





## Usage
After setting up the script, ensure it is executable and test it by running:

```bash
chmod +x your_script.sh
./your_script.sh
```

You should see the output file `aws_usage_report.txt` generated with the resource usage details.

### Setting Up Cron Job
To run the script daily at 6 PM, add the following line to your crontab:

```bash
0 18 * * * /path/to/your_script.sh
```
